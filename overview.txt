Contextual Premise Framework (CPF)
Project Overview

The Contextual Premise Framework (CPF) is a conceptual model describing
the structural space of premises underlying intelligent judgment.  
This project provides the three core papers that define CPF and explain
how premise structures are organized, transformed, and sustained over time.

---

## 1. Purpose of the Project
Judgment and interpretation rely on multiple forms of underlying premises.
These premises are often implicit, layered, and interconnected.  
CPF aims to provide a clear structural vocabulary and a unified description
of how such premises are arranged and how they support reasoning.

This project offers:
- A structural classification of premises,
- A minimal mathematical formulation of premise regeneration,
- A loop mechanism explaining how premise updating remains active.

## 2. Components of the Framework

### Paper 1 — Structural Model (CPF)
Defines the premise space as a layered structure, including:
- existential, implicit, causal, situational, role, motivational,
  and action premises.

The paper also introduces:
- non-linear arrangement of layers,
- topological relations,
- adjacency and accessibility patterns.

This serves as the foundation of the entire framework.

### Paper 2 — Premise Regeneration (dP/dt)
Formalizes cognition as the rate of premise redefinition.
The paper introduces three basic relations:

- Cognition = dP/dt  
- P = g(P_prev, Δ)  
- Δ = h(∇P_unknown)

These describe how premise states evolve over time
through discrepancy-driven regeneration.

### Paper 3 — ADR (Adaptive/Dynamic Reasoning)
Presents a minimal loop model explaining sustained premise updating.
The ADR process:

1. unknown-region variation generates discrepancy (Δ),  
2. Δ leads to premise regeneration,  
3. regenerated premises modify unknown regions,  
4. new Δ is generated.

This loop accounts for continuous cognitive updating.

## 3. Intended Academic Use
The CPF materials are released for academic reading, citation,
and theoretical extension, provided the work remains within the
conceptual scope defined in the three papers.

The project welcomes:
- scholarly analysis,
- conceptual extensions,
- comparative theoretical work,
- discussion within cognitive science, AI safety,
  philosophy of reasoning, and related fields.
