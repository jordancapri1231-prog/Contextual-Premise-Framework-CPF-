ADR Operational Framework

(Supplement to the Contextual Premise Framework — Appendix A)

Title

Operational Framework for Intentional Activation of Adaptive / Dynamic Reasoning (ADR)
via Context-Based Premise Fixation

1. Overview

This document presents an operational-level framework for intentionally activating Adaptive / Dynamic Reasoning (ADR) within human–AI or human–human dialogue.

While the main ADR paper in the CPF project defines the theoretical loop of sustained premise regeneration, the purpose of this supplement is different:

To provide a practical, repeatable method for triggering ADR through controlled manipulation of premises and contextual questioning.

Traditional ADR appears only accidentally during deep reasoning or high-context problem solving.
This framework formalizes a way to induce ADR deliberately through structured interaction.

2. Core Idea

The system relies on two interacting components:

Premise Fixation Rule

Contextual Feedback Loop

Together, these create a dynamic environment in which the reasoning agent (human or AI) must continuously reinterpret and regenerate premises — the defining condition of ADR.

3. Premise Fixation Rule

At each step of questioning:

Multiple possible premises exist.

However, only one premise may be selected.

The selected premise must come from either:

Target Axis (e.g., number, scale, identity, priority)

Environment Axis (e.g., constraints, thresholds, conditions)

This restriction forces the reasoning agent to evaluate the relative importance of different premises and commit to one.

Premise fixation transforms the answer generation process from:

mere response → adaptive premise selection

This shift is what produces ADR conditions.

4. Contextual Feedback Loop

Once a premise is selected:

That selected premise is embedded into the next question.

This automatically changes the problem structure.

The agent must again choose a new premise under new constraints.

This creates perpetual re-evaluation and regeneration of premises.

This recursive loop is the operational mechanism that makes ADR inevitable rather than accidental.

5. Abstraction Strategy

To maintain generality and applicability:

The framework avoids dependence on specific examples.

All reasoning is framed through the two-axis structure (Target / Environment).

Concrete examples may be used for illustration, but the abstract form remains primary.

This ensures that the framework can be applied to:

education

dialogue design

cognitive testing

AI reasoning evaluation

problem-solving training

creative thinking exercises

6. Purpose and Limitations

This framework enables:

Activation of ADR in controlled settings

Structured reasoning tests

Cognitive exploration without biasing answers

Dynamic question reformulation

Premise-driven reasoning evaluation

However:

This is not a framework for ADR stabilization or extension.

For that, additional structures beyond the scope of this document are required.

This file is intended strictly as an operational supplement to the three core CPF papers.

7. Relation to CPF

This operational framework aligns with the CPF structure as follows:

CPF (Paper 1): Defines the premise space

dP/dt (Paper 2): Defines premise transformation

ADR (Paper 3): Defines sustained regeneration loops

This document:

Provides a practical method to trigger those loops through question–premise interactions

Thus, it should be understood as Appendix A of the CPF project.
